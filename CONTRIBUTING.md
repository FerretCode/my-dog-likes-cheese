# Are you looking to contribute to my-dog-likes-cheese? If so, your help is greatly appreciated!
We are actively looking for contributors to help grow and expand the capabilities of my-dog-likes-cheese.

# All of our code at the moment is inside of `index.js`. 

To write new code inside of `index.js`, create a new constant function and make sure to export it. If you want to follow our
naming convention, use UpperCamelCase and prefix the function name with JSON (we might expand further beyond JSON in the future)

Please create a new test case for your function iside of tests.js, and run it on test data from test.json.

# That's basically it!
